# Antibiotic prescribing in COPD patients in the CPRD database
This is the R code used to analyse the CPRD-HES data for paper "Opportunities to reduce antibiotic prescribing for patients with COPD in primary care: a cohort study using electronic health records from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD)" published in the Journal of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy. *Add DOI*

## Document structure
This project only contains the code used to produce all tables and figure in the above paper. No data can be provided, as we do not own any of the data and ethical approval to CPRD is required to obtain data. 

* Files prefixed by 00_ provide general functionality

* Files prefixed by 99_ provide fixes to R packages that should be fixed in future updates to R software in the UCL Data Safe Haven and within the packages

* All other files should be run in the order that they are indexed to provide the study results. Additional folders to hold raw and intermediate data is necessary.
